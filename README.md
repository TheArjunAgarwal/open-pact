# **OpenPact** 💍🔗  

**OpenPact** is an open-source **Haskell implementation** inspired by **Marriage Pact** ([marriagepact.com](https://www.marriagepact.com/)).  
It provides **algorithmic matchmaking** with modes for:  
✅ **Romantic matches(still to be configured)** (heterosexual & homosexual)  
✅ **Best friend matches** (platonic compatibility)  

Additionally, **data analysis tools** help uncover **patterns, anomalies, and correlations** in responses.

## **🚀 How It Works**
1. **Matchmaking Algorithm (Haskell)**  
   - Uses **Irving's Stable Roommates Algorithm** (`Irving.hs`) to compute optimal pairings.  
   - Reads participant responses from **`realData.csv`** (or `test.csv` for testing).  
   - Outputs results in **`matches.csv`** and **`top.csv`** (highest compatibility pairs).  

2. **Email Delivery (Python)**  
   - The **`email.py`** script sends match results via email.  

3. **Data Analysis (Python)**  
   - **`correlation.py`**: Finds relationships between questions.  
   - **`anomalies.py`**: Detects statistical oddities (polarized questions, fence-sitting, etc.).  
   - **Outputs:**  
     - **`pearson_correlation.csv`**, **`spearman_correlation.csv`**, **`kendall_correlation.csv`**  
     - **`correlation_heatmap.png`** (visual correlation map)  
     - **`statistical_anomalies.txt`**, **`strong_correlations.txt`**
