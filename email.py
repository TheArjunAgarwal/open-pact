Hi {name},

Great news! Based on your responses, weâ€™ve found a friendship match for you. Say hello to {match}!

ðŸ“© Email: {match_email}

I encourage you to reach out, introduce yourself, and give it a shotâ€”regardless of any prior experiences with this person. You never know what a fresh start could bring!

Additionally, if youâ€™d like, I can provide information about other people similar to you within the next 24 hours. This data will be completely wiped at 11:59 AM on February 9.

Just let me know if youâ€™re interested.

I may also send a single follow-up in about three months to see how things are going. No pressureâ€”just curious to hear how it worked out! Best of luck, and happy connecting!

Warm Regards,
Arjun Maneesh Agarwal
